Bitalino Controlled video player for performance

## Dependencies
To add dependencies, drag and drop the jar files on top of the Processing sketch in the app or else put them in a folder called "code".  Add both Bluecove jars and both jars from the bitalino downloads.

* Bitalino https://jar-download.com/artifacts/com.bitalino/bitalino-java-sdk/1.1.0/source-code
* Bluecove Mac and Win https://sourceforge.net/projects/bluecove/
* Bluecove Linux http://www.bluecove.org/bluecove-gpl/

If the bitalino jar link isn't working, you can also build the files from source via maven. See the [repository](https://github.com/BITalinoWorld/java-sdk) for more information.


### Linux
* Linux users also have system dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev`.

## Set-up
The bitalino is a bluetooth device that must be paired with the computer before it can be used. Do this the normal way for your operating system. The pin is 1234
